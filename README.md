Development Process
-------------------

For now I am the only developper, but I plan to hire new developpers as the need for it occurs. 
If you want to contribute to Imperium Core Developers, or have any kind of offers regarding Imperium Core, don't be afraid to PM me here on github.  " IMPERIUM-main-dev " is my github username.


Testing
-------

Tests are mainly made on my home server. If you want to contribute, I suggest you do the same and do multiple backups often enough so you don't lose your progress. Also, inform yourself on how github works from command line in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as this is the principal OS I use for development.



### Automated Testing

The Travis CI system will eventually be used to make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically. 


Translations

They are integrated from bitcoin's source code.
